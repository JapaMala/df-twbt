## Text Will Be Text ##

This is a plugin for [Dwarf Fortress](http://bay12games.com) / [DFHack](http://github.com/dfhack/dfhack) that improves various aspects of rendering.

I wrote this small plugin because I was tired seeing coffins instead of zeroes and all that stuff. It allows to specify separate fonts for map tiles and for text. GRAPHICS_FONT/GRAPHICS_FULLFONT will continue to be used for map area(s), and FONT/FULLFONT will be used for everything else. Requires OpenGL PRINT_MODE (STANDARD, VBO and so on). Adventurer mode and possibly some other screens need some more work.

### Overrides ###

Also it allows to override tile numbers for buildings and items, see overrides.txt for details.
