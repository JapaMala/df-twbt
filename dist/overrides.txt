# This file is a part of Text Will Be Text plugin

# This file should be placed into data/init and allows to load additional tilesets
# and override tile numbers for certain item/building types.

# Load additional tileset if you ran out of tiles in main and text fonts
# [TILESET:font.png:fullscreenfont.png:Id] 
# File names are relative to data/art folder
# Id is arbitrary string to refer this tileset in OVERRIDE commands

# Add an override
# [OVERRIDE:Tile:Kind:Id:Type:Subtype:Tileset:NewTile]
# Tile is the original tile number
# Kind is I for item or B for building
# Id see buildings_other_id.h or items_other_id.h (case-sensitive!)
# Type see building_type.h or item_type.h, may be empty (case-sensitive!)
# Subtype is some numeric value, don't know what values correspond to what
# Tileset is the tileset to use
#   map  is the main tileset
#   text is the text tileset loaded by this plugin
#   <Id> tileset identifier specified in TILESET command
# NewTile is the new tile number

# Override tile if it didn't match any other rules
# Behaviour of this may change in future
# [OVERRIDE:Tile:Tileset:NewTile]

# Examples

# [OVERRIDE:177:B:WINDOW_ANY:WindowGem::map:48]
# Will make gem windows show as coffins (why not)
